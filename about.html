Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Pierce Community College. I'll be transferring to a UC that fits my desires. My passion for computers goes way back to when my dad got me my first computer in 5th grade, and ever since then, my passion has grown into a full-time career! I have found a love for programming, embedded development, and InfoSec. My interest in software and InfoSec started at a very young age, to be honest with you. It began when I learned about a recovery tool called Cain & Abel. This tool is used by cybersecurity professionals and nation-state actors. It can recover various kinds of passwords using methods such as network packet sniffing and dictionary attacks.</p>
