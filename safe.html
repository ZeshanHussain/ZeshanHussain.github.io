             After witnessing the devastating Uvalde shooting shortly after my high school graduation in May, I was deeply distressed. It was heartbreaking to see young lives filled with potential abruptly cut short. Motivated by the desire to make a difference, I dedicated my entire summer to seeking ways to prevent such tragedies. Eventually, I came up with an idea that could potentially save lives. My solution involves creating a camera that utilizes OpenCV, a computer vision library, to detect firearms. When the camera detects an individual carrying a gun, it will immediately trigger an alarm and simultaneously contact local law enforcement. This system aims to provide students with valuable extra time to seek cover and increase their chances of survival. To develop this innovative technology, I undertook the task of training an AI model using over 60,000 images. Using a toy gun, I constructed my own Cascade model , which served as a starting point. However, for the model to be more accurate and reliable, it is crucial to train it with real firearms data. This is where I require the support and collaboration of the community. The process of creating AI Cascade models involves training a computer model with a vast dataset of images to teach it how to identify specific objects or features within those images. This intricate process entails breaking down the detection problem into smaller, simpler components and creating classifiers for each part. Ultimately, these classifiers are combined into a cascade to effectively detect the desired objectâ€”in this case, firearms. Developing an accurate and dependable model demands a substantial investment of time, effort, and resources.       <sup class="footnote-reference">
